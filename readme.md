# HMG-RAG
HMG-RAG is an end-to-end document question-answering system based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It provides a full pipeline from document parsing and vector insertion to retrieval and answer generation.

# 🚀 Overview
HMG-RAG integrates several key components to support document-based question answering:
Document parsing and analysis using MinerU.
Graph construction and processing of extracted information.
Vector insertion into databases such as Nebula Graph and Milvus.
Retrieval of relevant content based on user queries.
Answer generation guided by retrieved context.
The system is designed to work with large collections of documents and to support retrieval and reasoning over structured and unstructured knowledge.

# 🧱 Architecture
HMG-RAG is composed of the following major parts:

├── DocProcess/           # Document parsing and processing

├── GraphProcess/         # Graph creation and manipulations

├── EntityExtraction/     # Entity detection and Linking

├── Retrieval/            # Vector storage and search

├── Generation/           # LLM-based answer generation

├── MinerU/               # MinerU integration

├── LLM/                  # Large Language Model interfaces

├── Utils/                # Utilities and helpers

├── main.py               # Main entrypoint

├── data/pdf              # Example documents
